# Challenge Chart Plot

## Technologies

__React:__ Used for creating the web page. React has been my professional focus, so I have more experience and comfort with technology.

__TypeScript:__ The application uses static typing with TypeScript. As a result, the code gains reliability, organization and readability.   

__Styled Components:__ Styled Components is responsible for the application's theme and the components' CSS. It provides a great ease in styling and has features such as global styles and theme definition, so I decided to use it. 

__Nivo:__ A graphics library, I chose nivo because I've used it before and because it's very simple.

__CodeMirror:__ I used CodeMirror because I have already used it in other projects, so it would be easier to use something I already know.

__Jest:__ React already has jest configured, including to perform component tests, I practically only use Jest and Cypress (end-to-end), since Jest is already configured, that's what I decided to use.

__Moment:__ An amazing tool for working with dates, I had no reason not to use it.

__Polished:__ Sometimes I need a color variation, be it darkening, lightening or making it transparent, and polished helps me in all that.

## Protection for Huge Amount of Data

Honestly, I thought a lot about this question, but an ideal solution to the problem didn't come to my mind. I tried to make the application as simple and performative as possible to avoid problems

I thought of some solutions, but without having more details on how these data are usually it is very difficult to think of the most appropriate solution.

I thought of strategies to not display all the data on the chart at once, maybe a filter or a pagination, however, what would be the best way to do this? I can't say because of the lack of information about the pattern of the data that will be used to generate the chart.

The best approach in my opinion was to have a back-end that would make life as easy as possible for the front-end, delivering formatted and validated data, thus reducing the processes that the application would have to execute, in fact, unlike the back-end that we have control of its technical specifications, the front-end runs on the user's machine, which will not necessarily have a good performance.

## Final considerations

I really enjoyed participating in the selection process, personally I wanted to be able to better understand the data that would be provided and develop a backend for the application.

I would appreciate it a lot if you gave me some feedback, it's always good to know the opinion about the project, it usually helps a lot in the evolution of the developer.

Anyway, thanks for the opportunity to be part of it, I'll be looking forward to the result. :smile:
